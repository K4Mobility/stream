## Installation

Use `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/K4Mobility/stream
```

## Example Usage

In-depth examples are provided in the [examples](https://github.com/K4Mobility/stream/tree/master/examples) directory, but a small taste is provided below:

```go
// tracks the autocorrelation over a
// rolling window of size 15 and lag of 5
autocorr, err := joint.NewAutocorr(5, 15)
// handle err

// all metrics in the joint package must be passed
// through joint.Init in order to consume values
err = joint.Init(autocorr)
// handle err

// tracks the global median using a pair of heaps
median, err := quantile.NewGlobalHeapMedian()
// handle err

for i := 0., i < 100; i++ {
    err = autocorr.Push(i)
    // handle err

    err = median.Push(i)
    // handle err
}

autocorrVal, err := autocorr.Value()
// handle err

medianVal, err := median.Value()
// handle err

fmt.Println("%s: %f", autocorr.String(), autocorrVal)
fmt.Println("%s: %f", median.String(), medianVal)
```

## Statistics

For time/space complexity details on the algorithms listed below, see [here](complexity.md).

### [Quantile](https://godoc.org/github.com/K4Mobility/stream/quantile)

#### Quantile

Quantile keeps track of the quantiles of a stream. Quantile can calculate the global quantiles of a stream, or over a rolling window. You can also configure which implementation to use as the underlying data structure, as well as which interpolation method to use in the case that a quantile actually lies in between two elements. For now [skip lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list) as well as [order statistic trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic_tree) (in particular modified forms of [AVL trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) and [red black trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree)) are supported.

#### Median

Median keeps track of the median of a stream; this is simply a convenient wrapper over [Quantile](#Quantile), that automatically sets the quantile to be 0.5 and the interpolation method to be the midpoint method.

#### IQR

IQR keeps track of the [interquartile range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range) of a stream; this is simply a convenient wrapper over [Quantile](#Quantile), that retrieves the 1st and 3rd quartiles and sets the interpolation method to be the midpoint method.

#### HeapMedian

HeapMedian keeps track of the median of a stream with a pair of [heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)). In particular, it uses a max-heap and a min-heap to keep track of elements below and above the median, respectively. HeapMedian can calculate the global median of a stream, or over a rolling window.

### [Min/Max](https://godoc.org/github.com/K4Mobility/stream/minmax)

#### Min

Min keeps track of the minimum of a stream; it can track either the global minimum, or over a rolling window.

#### Max

Max keeps track of the maximum of a stream; it can track either the global maximum, or over a rolling window.

### [Moment-Based Statistics](https://godoc.org/github.com/K4Mobility/stream/moment)

#### Mean

Mean keeps track of the mean of a stream; it can track either the global mean, or over a rolling window.

#### EWMA

EWMA keeps track of the global [exponentially weighted moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average).

#### Moment

Moment keeps track of the `k`-th sample [central moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_moment); it can track either the global moment, or over a rolling window.

#### EWMMoment

EWMMoment keeps track of the global `k`-sample exponentially weighted moving sample [central moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_moment). This uses the exponentially weighted moving average as its center of mass, and uses the same exponential weights for its power terms.

#### Std

Std keeps track of the sample [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of a stream; it can track either the global standard deviation, or over a rolling window. To track the sample [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) instead, you should use [Moment](#Moment), i.e.

```go
variance := New(2, window)
```

#### EWMStd

EWMStd keeps track of the global [exponentially weighted moving standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponentially_weighted_moving_variance_and_standard_deviation). To track the exponentially weighted moving variance instead, you should use [EWMMoment](#EWMMoment), i.e.

```go
variance := NewEWMMoment(2, decay)
```

#### Skewness

Skewness keeps track of the sample [skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) of a stream (in particular, the [adjusted Fisher-Pearson standardized moment coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness#Sample_skewness)); it can track either the global skewness, or over a rolling window.

#### Kurtosis

Kurtosis keeps track of the sample [kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis) of a stream (in particular, the [sample excess kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis#Sample_kurtosis)); it can track either the global kurtosis, or over a rolling window.

#### Core (Univariate)

Core is the struct powering all of the statistics in the `stream/moment` subpackage; it keeps track of a pre-configured set of centralized `k`-th power sums of a stream in an efficient, numerically stable way; it can track either the global sums, or over a rolling window.

To configure which sums to track, you'll need to instantiate a `CoreConfig` struct and provide it to `NewCore`:

```go
config := &moment.CoreConfig{
    Sums: SumsConfig{
        2: true, // tracks the sum of squared differences
        3: true, // tracks the sum of cubed differences
    },
    Window: stream.IntPtr(0),    // tracks global sums
    Decay: stream.FloatPtr(0.3), // tracks exponentially weighted sums with a decay factor of 0.3
}
core, err := NewCore(config)
```

See the [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/K4Mobility/stream/moment#Core) entry for more details on Core's methods.

### [Joint Distribution Statistics](https://godoc.org/github.com/K4Mobility/stream/joint)

#### Cov

Cov keeps track of the sample [covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance) of a stream; it can track either the global covariance, or over a rolling window.

#### EWMCov

EWMCov keeps track of the global exponentially weighted sample [covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance) of a stream. This uses the exponentially weighted moving average as its center of mass, and uses the same exponential weights for its power terms.

#### Corr

Corr keeps track of the sample [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation) of a stream (in particular, the [sample Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient#For_a_sample)); it can track either the global correlation, or over a rolling window.

#### EWMCorr

EWMCorr keeps track of the global sample exponentially weighted [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation) of a stream (in particular, the exponentially weighted [sample Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient#For_a_sample)). This uses the exponentially weighted moving average as its center of mass, and uses the same exponential weights for its power terms.

#### Autocorr

Autocorr keeps track of the sample [autocorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation) of a stream (in particular, the [sample autocorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation#Estimation)) for a given lag; it can track either the global autocorrelation, or over a rolling window.

#### Autocov

Autocov keeps track of the sample [autocovariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocovariance) of a stream (in particular, the sample autocovariance) for a given lag; it can track either the global autocovariance, or over a rolling window.

#### Core (Multivariate)

Core is the struct powering all of the statistics in the `stream/joint` subpackage; it keeps track of a pre-configured set of joint centralized power sums of a stream in an efficient, numerically stable way; it can track either the global sums, or over a rolling window.

To configure which sums to track, you'll need to instantiate a `CoreConfig` struct and provide it to `NewCore`:

```go
config := &joint.CoreConfig{
    Sums: SumsConfig{
        {1, 1}, // tracks the joint sum of differences
        {2, 0}, // tracks the sum of squared differences of variable 1
    },
    Vars: stream.IntPtr(2),      // declares that there are 2 variables to track (optional if Sums is set)
    Window: stream.IntPtr(0),    // tracks global sums
    Decay: stream.FloatPtr(0.3), // tracks exponentially weighted sums with a decay factor of 0.3
}
core, err := NewCore(config)
```

See the [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/K4Mobility/stream/joint#Core) entry for more details on Core's methods.

### [Aggregate Statistics](https://godoc.org/github.com/K4Mobility/stream/aggregate)

#### SimpleAggregateMetric

SimpleAggregateMetric is a convenience wrapper that stores multiple univariate metrics and will push a value to all metrics simultaneously; instead of returning a single scalar, it returns a map of metrics to their corresponding values.

#### SimpleJointAggregateMetric

SimpleJointAggregateMetric is a convenience wrapper that stores multiple multivariate metrics and will push a value to all metrics simultaneously; instead of returning a single scalar, it returns a map of metrics to their corresponding values.
